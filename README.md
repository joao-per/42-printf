## 🗣️ About

This project is pretty straight foward. I tried to replicate the original printf.

For detailed information, refer to the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/joao-per/42-printf/blob/main/Subject.pdf).

## 🛠️ Download

### Requirements

The library is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

```shell
git clone https://github.com/joao-per/Printf.git
```
There are also some basics tests that you can try in your own printf. Just compile the tester with your output.
